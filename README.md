# Primitives

Small godot game using mostly primitive geometry. The player is a triangle.
The goal is to reach the end of the level. The pentagons are enemies, avoid
them or they will catch you. The player can hide in triangle shaped gaps in
the walls. However hiding is only successfull if the player has the same
color as the wall. The player can use power ups to change the color.
